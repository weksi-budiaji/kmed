Description: Algorithms of distance-based k-medoids clustering: simple and fast 
  k-medoids, ranked k-medoids, and increasing number of clusters in k-medoids. 
  Calculate distances for mixed variable data such as Gower, Podani, Wishart, 
  Huang, Harikumar-PV, and Ahmad-Dey. Cluster validation applies internal and 
  relative criteria. The internal criteria includes silhouette index and shadow 
  values. The relative criterium applies bootstrap procedure producing a heatmap 
  with a flexible reordering matrix algorithm such as complete, ward, or average 
  linkages. The cluster result can be plotted in a marked barplot or pca biplot.
